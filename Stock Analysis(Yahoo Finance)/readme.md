##Welcome to Stock Market Analysis project!

In this portfolio project I have done an analysis on stocks from five different companies in healthcare industry over the stock data for one year time period. I have used pandas to get stock information from yahoo Finance, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I have analyzed the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I have also used Monte Carlo method to predict future stock price.

In the projects the following questions will be answerd through analysis and visualization.

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?

3.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?

4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?

5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
